<p>We at Anurag Toastmasters conduct meetings twice a month.A usual toastmaster meeting twice a month.A usual toastmaster meeting can be classified into 3 segments:
<br>
1.Prepared speeches segments
<br>
2.Table topics segment
<br>
3.Evaluation segment           ​
<br>
In the prepared speeches segment,speakers​ prepare speeches before hand and present them.They are mentored well before the meeting by experienced mentors in toastmasters fraternity.This helps the members in the organising skills and improves their planning skills.
<br>
In the table topics segment,speakers are given a topic and made to speak then and there.They are made to think on their feet and this helps in improving their impromptu speaking skills.
<br>
In the evaluations segment,prepared speakers are evaluated based on their speech objectives laid down by Toastmasters International and are given constructive feedback which helps in improving themselves.
<br>
​<br>
